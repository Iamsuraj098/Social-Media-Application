React Router: 
We move from one page to another or open a new component in same page without rendering whole page.
Client side rendering. 

for installing in router: npm install react-router-dom
"Switch" is removed from new version of router at place of it we use "Routes"

Here we use: 
BrowserRouter
Routes
Route
Link
